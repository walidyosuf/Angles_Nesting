# Angles_Nesting
Linear cutting nesting for angles
A web application for calculating optimal cutting plans for materials (like steel bars) to minimize waste. The application processes Excel files containing item specifications and raw material codes to generate efficient cutting patterns.

Features
✅ Responsive Design: Works perfectly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
✅ Multilingual Support: English and Arabic interfaces
✅ Efficiency Analysis: Calculates efficiency percentage and waste percentage
✅ Waste Report: Identifies waste pieces ≥ 1500mm
✅ Detailed Cutting Patterns: Shows individual cutting patterns for each section and steel type
✅ PDF Export: Export results to PDF for printing or sharing
✅ Excel Input: Process data from standard Excel files
How It Works
Upload an Excel file containing the items to be cut (with 5 columns: Section, Name, Length, Quantity, Steel Type)
Upload an Excel file containing raw material codes (with 3 columns: Section, Steel Type, Raw Material Code)
Click "Execute" to process the data
View the cutting plan summary, waste report, and detailed cutting patterns
Export the results to PDF if needed
Usage
Step 1: Prepare Your Excel Files
Items File Format (5 columns):

Column A: Section (e.g., "Beam", "Column")
Column B: Item Name
Column C: Length (in mm)
Column D: Quantity
Column E: Steel Type (e.g., "S235", "S355")
Raw Material Codes File Format (3 columns):

Column A: Section
Column B: Steel Type
Column C: Raw Material Code (e.g., "RB-12000" for 12m bars)
Step 2: Run the Application
Open the application in your browser
Click "Choose Items File" and select your items Excel file
Click "Choose Raw Material Codes File" and select your raw materials Excel file
Click "Execute" to process the data
View the results:
Summary table showing efficiency and waste percentages
Waste report for pieces ≥ 1500mm
Detailed cutting patterns for each section and steel type
Step 3: Export Results
Click "Print / Export to PDF" to export the results to a PDF file for printing or sharing.
